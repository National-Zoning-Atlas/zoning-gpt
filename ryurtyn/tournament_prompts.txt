INDEX 1
Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

You are an expert architectural lawyer. You are looking for facts inside a
document about a Zoning District with the name "Village Overlay" and with an
abbreviated name "VDO".

You are looking to find the value for "min_lot_size", which also goes by the
following other names: min lot size, min lot coverage, min parcel size, min lot and building, area and bulk, min dimensional, min lot area, lot area, min area, min lot area, min lot and area, min lot, min lot requirements, min parcel area, lot size, lot and building, dimensional, min lot, lot requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements. You will be shown a list of page contents
from a document. You will also be shown a possible value for min_lot_size that was
extracted from the text, along with the rationale for that extraction. Your job
is output the index of the correct answer, as supported by the text. If neither 
answer is correct, you should return -1. For min_lot_size in residential districts, 
we are only interested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.

Output MUST be a single integer, the 0-based index that selects the best answer
from the list below. If you think both answers are incorrect, return the integer -1 to 
indicate that there is no answer. Do not provide any explanation.

Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

Answer: Cannot determine from provided input
Rationale: The table on this page lists the minimum lot requirements for different zones. For the POR zone, the minimum lot area is 3 acres, and for the OP zone, it is 15,000 sq ft. Since the document does not specify the Village Overlay (VDO) zone directly, we refer to the footnote (1) which states that for single-family detached dwellings, the area and bulk requirements are the same as those for the R-21 district. However, the R-21 district requirements are not provided in this input, so we cannot determine the min_lot_size for the VDO zone based on this information.

Answer: 10 acres
Rationale: The section titled '7.10.E Eligibility' specifies the minimum lot size for a tract to be eligible for a Conservation Development.
Extracted Text: ['A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area']
Supporting Text:
 number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined
by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by
dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the
zoning district in which the tract is located.
2.
Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric
transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for
development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the
maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3.
The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula
when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better
used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and
Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater
than 20 percent of the formula calculation.

7.10.E Eligibility.
A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area, except that if, in the opinion of the Commission
the shape, topography, existence of wetlands or watercourses, or other unique features
should be preserved for the benefit of the community, or the tract is contiguous to a
previously approved Conservation Development, the provisions of this Section may be
applied to any parcel of land.
7.10.F Buffers.
To insure the protection of existing residences contiguous to a tract of land for which approval
of a Conservation Development is sought, the Commission may require that new lots be
separated from existing contiguous parcels by a distance equal to the rear yard requirement
for the district in which the tract is located, or by the introduction of buffer plantings.
7.10.G Utilities Required.
The tract of land proposed for development under this Section shall be served by public water
supply and sewage disposal systems. The Commission may permit an alternative method of
water supply or sewage disposal, provided such systems are approved by the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection and the West Hartford-Bloomfield Health District, as
appropriate.

Answer: 10 acres
Rationale: The section titled '7.10.E Eligibility' specifies the minimum lot size for a tract to be eligible for a Conservation Development.
Extracted Text: ['A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area']
Supporting Text:
 number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined
by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by
dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the
zoning district in which the tract is located.
2.
Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric
transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for
development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the
maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3.
The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula
when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better
used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and
Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater
than 20 percent of the formula calculation.
Page 166 - Bloomfield Zoning Regulations - 8.15.2009 (07/06/20)

NEW PAGE 175
7.10.E Eligibility.
A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area, except that if, in the opinion of the Commission
the shape, topography, existence of wetlands or watercourses, or other unique features
should be preserved for the benefit of the community, or the tract is contiguous to a
previously approved Conservation Development, the provisions of this Section may be
applied to any parcel of land.
7.10.F Buffers.
To insure the protection of existing residences contiguous to a tract of land for which approval
of a Conservation Development is sought, the Commission may require that new lots be
separated from existing contiguous parcels by a distance equal to the rear yard requirement
for the district in which the tract is located, or by the introduction of buffer plantings.
7.10.G Utilities Required.
The tract of land proposed for development under this Section shall be served by public water
supply and sewage disposal systems. The Commission may permit an alternative method of
water supply or sewage disposal, provided such systems are approved by the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection and the West Hartford-Bloomfield Health District, as
appropriate.

Answer: 10 acres
Rationale: The section titled '7.10.E Eligibility' specifies the minimum lot size for a tract to be eligible for a Conservation Development.
Extracted Text: ['A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area']
Supporting Text:
 number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined
by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by
dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the
zoning district in which the tract is located.
2.
Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric
transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for
development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the
maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3.
The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula
when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better
used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and
Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater
than 20 percent of the formula calculation.

should be preserved for the benefit of the community, or the tract is contiguous to a
previously approved Conservation Development, the provisions of this Section may be
applied to any parcel of land.
7.10.F Buffers.
To insure the protection of existing residences contiguous to a tract of land for which approval
of a Conservation Development is sought, the Commission may require that new lots be
separated from existing contiguous parcels by a distance equal to the rear yard requirement
for the district in which the tract is located, or by the introduction of buffer plantings.

Answer: 10 acres
Rationale: The section titled '7.10.E Eligibility' specifies the minimum lot size for a tract to be eligible for a Conservation Development.
Extracted Text: ['A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area']
Supporting Text:
 number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined
by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by
dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the
zoning district in which the tract is located.
2.
Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric
transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for
development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the
maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3.
The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula
when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better
used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and
Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater
than 20 percent of the formula calculation.
Page 166 - Bloomfield Zoning Regulations - 8.15.2009 (07/06/20)

NEW PAGE 175
7.10.E Eligibility.
A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area, except that if, in the opinion of the Commission
the shape, topography, existence of wetlands or watercourses, or other unique features
should be preserved for the benefit of the community, or the tract is contiguous to a
previously approved Conservation Development, the provisions of this Section may be
applied to any parcel of land.
7.10.F Buffers.
To insure the protection of existing residences contiguous to a tract of land for which approval
of a Conservation Development is sought, the Commission may require that new lots be
separated from existing contiguous parcels by a distance equal to the rear yard requirement
for the district in which the tract is located, or by the introduction of buffer plantings.
7.10.G Utilities Required.
The tract of land proposed for development under this Section shall be served by public water
supply and sewage disposal systems. The Commission may permit an alternative method of
water supply or sewage disposal, provided such systems are approved by the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection and the West Hartford-Bloomfield Health District, as
appropriate.

Answer: 10 acres
Rationale: The section titled '7.10.E Eligibility' specifies the minimum lot size for a tract to be eligible for a Conservation Development.
Extracted Text: ['A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area']
Supporting Text:
 number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined
by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by
dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the
zoning district in which the tract is located.
2.
Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric
transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for
development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the
maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3.
The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula
when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better
used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and
Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater
than 20 percent of the formula calculation.

7.10.E Eligibility.
A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area, except that if, in the opinion of the Commission
the shape, topography, existence of wetlands or watercourses, or other unique features
should be preserved for the benefit of the community, or the tract is contiguous to a
previously approved Conservation Development, the provisions of this Section may be
applied to any parcel of land.
7.10.F Buffers.
To insure the protection of existing residences contiguous to a tract of land for which approval
of a Conservation Development is sought, the Commission may require that new lots be
separated from existing contiguous parcels by a distance equal to the rear yard requirement
for the district in which the tract is located, or by the introduction of buffer plantings.
7.10.G Utilities Required.
The tract of land proposed for development under this Section shall be served by public water
supply and sewage disposal systems. The Commission may permit an alternative method of
water supply or sewage disposal, provided such systems are approved by the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection and the West Hartford-Bloomfield Health District, as
appropriate.

Answer: 10 acres
Rationale: The section titled '7.10.E Eligibility' specifies the minimum lot size for a tract to be eligible for a Conservation Development.
Extracted Text: ['A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area']
Supporting Text:
 number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined
by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by
dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the
zoning district in which the tract is located.
2.
Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric
transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for
development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the
maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3.
The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula
when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better
used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and
Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater
than 20 percent of the formula calculation.
Page 166 - Bloomfield Zoning Regulations - 8.15.2009 (07/06/20)

NEW PAGE 175
7.10.E Eligibility.
A tract shall be at least ten (10) acres in area, except that if, in the opinion of the Commission
the shape, topography, existence of wetlands or watercourses, or other unique features
should be preserved for the benefit of the community, or the tract is contiguous to a
previously approved Conservation Development, the provisions of this Section may be
applied to any parcel of land.
7.10.F Buffers.
To insure the protection of existing residences contiguous to a tract of land for which approval
of a Conservation Development is sought, the Commission may require that new lots be
separated from existing contiguous parcels by a distance equal to the rear yard requirement
for the district in which the tract is located, or by the introduction of buffer plantings.
7.10.G Utilities Required.
The tract of land proposed for development under this Section shall be served by public water
supply and sewage disposal systems. The Commission may permit an alternative method of
water supply or sewage disposal, provided such systems are approved by the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection and the West Hartford-Bloomfield Health District, as
appropriate.

It is not the intention to allow the creation of lots behind other existing properties
which would change the characteristics of the neighborhood. The Commission may
require a landscape buffer where necessary within the lot and along the access way
to ensure that any new development will be in harmony with the surrounding areas
and protect existing homes.
G. Cul-de-sac Lots
Where a portion or all of a lot is located along the main circular curve of the turnaround
area for a permanent cul-de-sac street that will not be further extended, the minimum lot
frontage may be measured along a building line parallel or concentric with the street line.
The distance between the street line and the building line used to measure the lot
frontage must be specified and must be at least 35 feet. This building line shall be
the
front building line for the lot and no building may be located between the front property
line and the front building line.
See the cul-de-sac drawing in the appendix.
H.
Frontage in Business Zones
The minimum lot frontage in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones shall be 200 feet,
and the minimum lot frontage in the Neighborhood Business and RMUZ Zones shall be
150 feet, provided that the Commission may, by Special Permit, allow a lesser frontage
where all of the following conditions exist:
a.
Driveways curb cuts in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones are no less

adjacent property. Driveways curb cuts in the Neighborhood Business and
RMUZ Zones are no less than 150 feet from any other driveway curb cut
located on the property or on an adjacent property.
b.
Two or more adjacent lots are under separate ownership but having a
combined frontage of at least 200 feet, with combined parking lots and driveway

Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided text
Rationale: The section titled 'Lot Density' provides a formula to calculate the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision, which indirectly gives us information about the minimum lot size. However, the exact traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone is not provided in the text, so we cannot extract a specific value for min_lot_size.
Extracted Text: ['Multiplying the total square footage of the subject parcel by 0.75, then dividing by the traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone in which the subject parcel is located, the resulting number (fraction removed) equals the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision.']

and protect existing homes.
G. Cul-de-sac Lots
Where a portion or all of a lot is located along the main circular curve of the turnaround

frontage may be measured along a building line parallel or concentric with the street line.
The distance between the street line and the building line used to measure the lot
frontage must be specified and must be at least 35 feet. This building line shall be
the
front building line for the lot and no building may be located between the front property
line and the front building line.

Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided text
Rationale: The section titled 'Lot Density' provides a formula to calculate the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision, which indirectly gives us information about the minimum lot size. However, the exact traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone is not provided in the text, so we cannot extract a specific value for min_lot_size.

It is not the intention to allow the creation of lots behind other existing properties
which would change the characteristics of the neighborhood. The Commission may
require a landscape buffer where necessary within the lot and along the access way
to ensure that any new development will be in harmony with the surrounding areas
and protect existing homes.
G. Cul-de-sac Lots
Where a portion or all of a lot is located along the main circular curve of the turnaround
area for a permanent cul-de-sac street that will not be further extended, the minimum lot
frontage may be measured along a building line parallel or concentric with the street line.
The distance between the street line and the building line used to measure the lot
frontage must be specified and must be at least 35 feet. This building line shall be
the
front building line for the lot and no building may be located between the front property
line and the front building line.

where all of the following conditions exist:
a.
Driveways curb cuts in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones are no less
than 200 feet from any other driveway curb cut located on the property or on an
adjacent property. Driveways curb cuts in the Neighborhood Business and
RMUZ Zones are no less than 150 feet from any other driveway curb cut
located on the property or on an adjacent property.

Answer: 200 feet
Rationale: The section titled 'Frontage in Business Zones' provides the minimum lot frontage requirement for the General Business Zone, which is closely related to the minimum lot size.
Extracted Text: ['The minimum lot frontage in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones shall be 200 feet']
Supporting Text:

It is not the intention to allow the creation of lots behind other existing properties
which would change the characteristics of the neighborhood. The Commission may
require a landscape buffer where necessary within the lot and along the access way
to ensure that any new development will be in harmony with the surrounding areas
and protect existing homes.
G. Cul-de-sac Lots
Where a portion or all of a lot is located along the main circular curve of the turnaround
area for a permanent cul-de-sac street that will not be further extended, the minimum lot
frontage may be measured along a building line parallel or concentric with the street line.
The distance between the street line and the building line used to measure the lot
frontage must be specified and must be at least 35 feet. This building line shall be
the
front building line for the lot and no building may be located between the front property
line and the front building line.
See the cul-de-sac drawing in the appendix.
H.
Frontage in Business Zones
The minimum lot frontage in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones shall be 200 feet,
and the minimum lot frontage in the Neighborhood Business and RMUZ Zones shall be
150 feet, provided that the Commission may, by Special Permit, allow a lesser frontage
where all of the following conditions exist:
a.
Driveways curb cuts in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones are no less
than 200 feet from any other driveway curb cut located on the property or on an
adjacent property. Driveways curb cuts in the Neighborhood Business and
RMUZ Zones are no less than 150 feet from any other driveway curb cut
located on the property or on an adjacent property.
b.
Two or more adjacent lots are under separate ownership but having a
combined frontage of at least 200 feet, with combined parking lots and driveway
curb cuts and perpetual cross easements that provide for the maintenance of
parking areas, driveways, landscaping, and illumination; and provide cross
easements for signs at the driveway curb cuts such that all business located on
the lots shall share a single Ground Sign for the entire development.

Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided text
Rationale: The section titled 'Lot Density' provides a formula to calculate the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision, which indirectly gives us information about the minimum lot size. However, the exact traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone is not provided in the text, so we cannot extract a specific value for min_lot_size.
Extracted Text: ['Multiplying the total square footage of the subject parcel by 0.75, then dividing by the traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone in which the subject parcel is located, the resulting number (fraction removed) equals the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision.']

Answer: 200 feet
Rationale: The section titled 'Frontage in Business Zones' provides the minimum lot frontage requirement for the General Business Zone, which is closely related to the minimum lot size.

It is not the intention to allow the creation of lots behind other existing properties
which would change the characteristics of the neighborhood. The Commission may
require a landscape buffer where necessary within the lot and along the access way
to ensure that any new development will be in harmony with the surrounding areas
and protect existing homes.
G. Cul-de-sac Lots
Where a portion or all of a lot is located along the main circular curve of the turnaround
area for a permanent cul-de-sac street that will not be further extended, the minimum lot
frontage may be measured along a building line parallel or concentric with the street line.
The distance between the street line and the building line used to measure the lot
frontage must be specified and must be at least 35 feet. This building line shall be
the
front building line for the lot and no building may be located between the front property
line and the front building line.
See the cul-de-sac drawing in the appendix.
H.
Frontage in Business Zones
The minimum lot frontage in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones shall be 200 feet,
and the minimum lot frontage in the Neighborhood Business and RMUZ Zones shall be
150 feet, provided that the Commission may, by Special Permit, allow a lesser frontage
where all of the following conditions exist:
a.
Driveways curb cuts in the General Business and GMUIZ Zones are no less
than 200 feet from any other driveway curb cut located on the property or on an
adjacent property. Driveways curb cuts in the Neighborhood Business and
RMUZ Zones are no less than 150 feet from any other driveway curb cut
located on the property or on an adjacent property.
b.
Two or more adjacent lots are under separate ownership but having a
combined frontage of at least 200 feet, with combined parking lots and driveway
curb cuts and perpetual cross easements that provide for the maintenance of
parking areas, driveways, landscaping, and illumination; and provide cross
easements for signs at the driveway curb cuts such that all business located on
the lots shall share a single Ground Sign for the entire development.

Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided text
Rationale: The section titled 'Lot Density' provides a formula to calculate the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision, which indirectly gives us information about the minimum lot size. However, the exact traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone is not provided in the text, so we cannot extract a specific value for min_lot_size.
Extracted Text: ['Multiplying the total square footage of the subject parcel by 0.75, then dividing by the traditional minimum lot area for the Residence Zone in which the subject parcel is located, the resulting number (fraction removed) equals the maximum number of lots within an OSCD subdivision.']

Commission may consider granting any of the following Special Exceptions:
a. Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit, Minimum: Waive 2,700 square foot
minimum lot area per dwelling unit.
b. Height restriction: "Height" limitation may be increased from 45 feet to
60 feet if the "Setback" from another residential zone is no less than the
maximum height of the primary building(s) on the site.
C.
Parking would not be allowed within the area between the face of the
building and the street; however it would be allowed within the side and
rear yard setbacks with the appropriate landscaping buffers.

# Instructions

You are an expert architectural lawyer. You are looking for facts inside a
document about a Zoning District with the name "Mixed Use Neighborhood Corners" and with an
abbreviated name "MXN".

You are looking to find the value for "min_lot_size", which also goes by the
following other names: min lot size, min lot coverage, min parcel size, min lot and building, area and bulk, min dimensional, min lot area, lot area, min area, min lot area, min lot and area, min lot, min lot requirements, min parcel area, lot size, lot and building, dimensional, min lot, lot requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements. You will be shown a list of page contents
from a document. You will also be shown a possible value for min_lot_size that was
extracted from the text, along with the rationale for that extraction. Your job
is output the index of the correct answer, as supported by the text. If neither 
answer is correct, you should return -1. For min_lot_size in residential districts, 
we are only interested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.

Output MUST be a single integer, the 0-based index that selects the best answer
from the list below. If you think both answers are incorrect, return the integer -1 to 
indicate that there is no answer. Do not provide any explanation.

Commission may consider granting any of the following Special Exceptions:
a. Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit, Minimum: Waive 2,700 square foot
minimum lot area per dwelling unit.
b. Height restriction: "Height" limitation may be increased from 45 feet to
60 feet if the "Setback" from another residential zone is no less than the
maximum height of the primary building(s) on the site.
