You will be given a possible value for min_lot_size. You will also be given a rationale for the answer as well as an extracted chunk of text relevant to the answer.

For min_lot_size in residential districts, we are only interested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes. Pay extra attention to the district referenced in the text.

You will be given a possible value for min_lot_size. You will also be given a rationale for the answer as well as an extracted chunk of text relevant to the answer.

You will be given a possible value for min_lot_size. You will also be given a rationale for the answer as well as an extracted chunk of text relevant to the answer.
