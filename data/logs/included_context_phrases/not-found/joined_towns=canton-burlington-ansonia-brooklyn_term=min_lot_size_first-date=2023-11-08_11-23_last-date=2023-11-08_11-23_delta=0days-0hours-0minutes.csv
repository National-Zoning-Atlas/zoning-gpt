THE PLANNING ZONING COMMISSION
CITY OF ANSONIA, CONNECTICUT
SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL STATEMENT
(Attached to and part of all Zoning Permits)
Dwelling Construction on all lots requires soil erosion and sediment control measures.
The ABSOLUTE MINIMUM requirement for construction of a single-family or two-family
dwelling, or additions or buildings accessory thereto, are a construction entrance, hay bales or
filter fence down slope from all ""distributed areas"" and all stockpiled materials protected by a
filter fence or hay bales. All measures are to be installed in accordance with the Connecticut
Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control.
Detailed requirements of soil erosion and sediment control plans are found in Section 520,
Ansonia Zoning Ordinance.
Failure to install and maintain required control measures is a violation of the Zoning Ordinance
and may result in an order to cease and desist from all construction until the violation is
corrected.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer is to be notified 48 hours in advance of construction to allow
inspection of installed soil erosion and sediment control measure.
CERTIFICATION:
I have read and understand the above, and I hereby accept the obligation to provide proper soil
erosion and sediment control measures and maintain such until the ""disturbed area"" has been
fully stabilized.
